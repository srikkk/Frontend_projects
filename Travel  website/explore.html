            The largest of Norway's fjords, Sognefjord reaches 204 kilometers inland from the coastal village of Skjolden and branches off into countless smaller inlets and fjords along the way. At its widest, the King of the Fjords (as it's known by Norwegians) is almost five kilometers across, and the cliff walls reach as high as 1,307 meters, making a breathtaking sight.
            The most popular way to visit the fjord is by boat, and fjord cruises and sightseeing tours are plentiful. Many of the best tour options depart conveniently from the attractive town of Bergen (be sure to allow a full day for your adventure).
            Tourists will also enjoy exploring the narrower branches like Naeroyfjord, a spectacular 17-kilometer stretch with cliff walls that are only 250 meters apart and tower more than 1,700 meters above the water.
            Another top destination is Fjærland. This stunningly beautiful region is home to Europe's biggest glacier, Jostedalsbreen, and the Norwegian Glacier Museum.
            A tourist attraction best suited for the active traveler thanks to the arduous journey required to get there, Pulpit Rock (Preikestolen) is nevertheless one of the most popular sights in Norway. Located near Stavanger, the destination requires ferry and bus rides and then a two-hour uphill hike to reach the almost perfectly flat-topped cliff, which looks over Lysefjord, more than 600 meters above the water.

                Banff National Park lies in the heart of the majestic Rocky Mountains in the province of Alberta, and showcases some of Canada's most beautiful scenery. Turquoise-colored lakes, snow-capped peaks, and glaciers are all easily accessible in this stunning park.
                The jewel of the park is Lake Louise, where green waters reflect the surrounding mountains and glaciers, and visitors can stroll easily around the shores. Just a short distance is Moraine Lake, another impressive alpine lake with an even slightly more dramatic surrounding.
                The Icefields Parkway, which runs from Lake Louise to Jasper, is an unforgettable drive and another major attraction in Banff. At the south end of the park is the lovely little town of Banff, providing all kinds of options for accommodation, shopping, dining, and nightlife.
                 Banff is also a major winter sports area and home to Lake Louise Ski Resort and Sunshine Village, two of Canada's most prominent ski destinations.

                The symbol of Paris, the Eiffel Tower is a feat of ingenuity as much as it is a famous landmark. This structure of 8,000 metallic parts was designed by Gustave Eiffel as a temporary exhibit for the World Fair of 1889. Originally loathed by critics, the 320-meter-high tower is now a beloved and irreplaceable fixture of the Paris skyline.
                The Eiffel Tower's gracefulness has earned it the nickname of "Iron Lady." Visitors are impressed by the tower's delicate airiness despite its monumental size and the breathtaking panoramas at each of the three levels.
                Tourists can dine with a view at the first level or indulge at the Michelin-starred Le Jules Verne restaurant on the second level. At the exhilarating height of 276 meters, the top level offers a sweeping outlook over the city of Paris and beyond. Vistas extend as far as 70 kilometers on a clear day.
                The most fashionable stretch of coastline in France, the Côte d'Azur extends from Saint-Tropez to Menton near the border with Italy. Côte d'Azur translates to "Coast of Blue," a fitting name to describe the Mediterranean's mesmerizing cerulean waters. To English speakers, this glamorous seaside destination is known as the French Riviera, words that have a ring of sun-drenched decadence.
